# Hologram
Human hologram detection / generation

cos^2(E)) (again)
cose^2(E) * ln(pi)
differential equations
BSDF
AI
signal processing


1/ use cos^2(E)
2/ use local mmodels (our chess engine for example)
3/Use mathematical harmony (the last thing I described with AI neural network)
4/ use textures as BSDF
5/ use textures similarities to merge bsdf and cos^2(e) and use  cos^2(E) * ln(pi)
6/ use signal theory

use prime numbers approcimation to prevent using models. This will also prevent using  database for fake persons. It's more efficient too.
f(x) = exp(x)+log(x)+x^3 +x^2+x+ sqrt(pi)

Differential equations ???
Coming soon.
