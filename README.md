# Hologram
Human hologram detection / generation

cos^2(E)) (again)
cose^2(E) * ln(pi)
differential equations
BSDF
AI
signal processing


1/ use cos^2(E)
2/ use local mmodels (our chess engine for example)
3/Use mathematical harmony (the last thing I described with AI neural network)
4/ use textures as BSDF
5/ use textures similarities to merge bsdf and cos^2(e) and use  cos^2(E) * ln(pi)
6/ use signal theory

use prime numbers approcimation to prevent using models. This will also prevent using  database for fake persons. It's more efficient too.
f(x) = exp(x)+log(x)+x^3 +x^2+x+ sqrt(pi)

Finally, we couldn't prevent using models for hologram databse but we succeed to use only some non ethnic morphology behhaviour.
We did that by considering new type of mathematical groups that enable i^2 different from -1. So we must certainly use clifford groups and 
clifford aglebra maybe. Notice that all I said can exist owadays but I mostly do everything myself with colleagues. So, put this
step before signal processing or somewhere else and let's see the implmentation results that will be achieved at the end. I'm saying that we are
walking in the darkness now but keep in mind that the final result will be to see holograms with android phones that have no ethnic specific morphology.

Differential equations ???
Coming soon.
